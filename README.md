# Non-linear optics: solving the optical Bloch equations
The optical Bloch equations are used in the field of non-linear optics to model the interaction of a field with a two-level quantum system. Solving these equations gives rise to important “observables” such as the population density of the excited state and the complex coherence of the system. The rotating wave approximation can be used to simplify the equations and demonstrate the Rabi oscillations that occur in the system under the influence of a Gaussian pulse. Moving beyond the rotating wave approximation, the Bloch equations cannot be solved analytically. To solve the full form of the equations, the Runge-Kutta method is implemented to analyse the behaviour of the system. The solutions to these equations are a more accurate description of the field interactions with a two-level quantum system and are used to model the behaviour of the system under the influence of a full Rabi field. Finally, using fast Fourier transforms, the output of the two-level system in the frequency domain can be studied and used to explain the behaviour of the system when the applied field is changed.
